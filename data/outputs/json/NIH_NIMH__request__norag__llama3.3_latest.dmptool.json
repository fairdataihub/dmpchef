The types of scientific data expected to be generated include demographic and clinical datasets, standardized anxiety and resilience scales, behavioral task data, physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability), derived summary variables, and documentation (protocols, data dictionary, README). Given the longitudinal nature of the study and the collection of multi-modal data across multiple time points, a substantial amount of data is expected to be generated. The largest portion of storage will be dedicated to physiological data and raw task files.",
