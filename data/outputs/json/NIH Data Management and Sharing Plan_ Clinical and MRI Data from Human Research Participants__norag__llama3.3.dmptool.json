Specifically, the dataset will comprise participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data (structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS). The total volume of data will depend on the imaging protocols used and the derivatives retained, with imaging data expected to be the largest component.",
