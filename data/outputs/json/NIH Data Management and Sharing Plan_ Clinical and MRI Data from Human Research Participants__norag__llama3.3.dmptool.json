These include demographic and clinical data (in tabular form) collected from 110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls, as well as various MRI-based imaging data such as structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS. Additionally, derived imaging measures and features will be computed from the raw imaging data. The total volume of data is expected to be substantial, with the imaging data component being the largest. Specifically, participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants and multi-modal MRI imaging data are anticipated.",
