This includes tabular data for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data such as structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features. The total volume of data will depend on the specific imaging protocols used and the derivatives retained, but it is anticipated that the imaging data component will be the largest.",
