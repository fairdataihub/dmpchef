The dataset will comprise participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data. The total volume of the dataset will depend on the imaging protocols used and the derivatives retained, with the imaging data expected to be the largest component.",
