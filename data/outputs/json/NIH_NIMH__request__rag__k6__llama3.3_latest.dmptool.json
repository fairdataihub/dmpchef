This includes demographic and clinical datasets, standardized anxiety and resilience scales, behavioral task data, physiological measures such as heart rate variability, derived summary variables, and associated documentation (e.g., protocols, data dictionary, README files). The estimated amount of scientific data is substantial due to the longitudinal multi-modal datasets collected across multiple time points. Physiological data and raw task files are expected to represent the largest portion of storage.",
