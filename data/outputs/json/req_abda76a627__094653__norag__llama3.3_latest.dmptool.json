The types of scientific data expected to be generated include demographic and clinical datasets, standardized anxiety and resilience scales, behavioral task data, physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability), and derived summary variables. The estimated amount of scientific data is substantial due to the longitudinal multi-modal datasets collected across multiple time points, with physiological data and raw task files representing the largest portion of storage.",
