The latter includes structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features and supporting documentation such as data dictionaries, protocols, and README files. Specifically, the dataset will comprise participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data. The total volume of data will depend on the imaging protocols used and the retained derivatives, with imaging data expected to be the largest component.",
