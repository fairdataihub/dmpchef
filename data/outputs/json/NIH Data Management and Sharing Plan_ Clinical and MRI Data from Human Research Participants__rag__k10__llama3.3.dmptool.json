The latter includes structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features and supporting documentation such as data dictionaries, protocols, and README files. Specifically, the dataset will comprise participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data.",
