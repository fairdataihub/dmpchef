These include demographic and clinical data (tabular) collected from 110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls, as well as MRI-based imaging data. The MRI data will encompass structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features. Supporting documentation such as data dictionaries, protocols, and README files will also be generated. The total volume of the dataset is expected to be substantial, with participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants and multi-modal MRI imaging data.",
