The demographic and clinical data will include information such as age, race, gender, medical history, and standardized test scores for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls). The MRI-based imaging data will comprise structural MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H fMRS) scans. The total volume of the dataset is expected to be substantial, with the imaging data component being the largest.",

For example, software such as FSL (FMRIB Software Library), AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages), or MATLAB with specific toolboxes might be required for advanced analysis of fMRI and 1H fMRS data. These tools are widely used in the neuroimaging community and can be accessed through their respective websites or academic licenses.\n\n## **Element 3: Standards**\nTo enable interoperability of datasets and resources, we will apply common data standards to our scientific data and associated metadata. Specifically:\n- Demographic and clinical data will be formatted according to standardized tabular structures (e.g., CSV files with clear headers).\n- MRI imaging data will adhere to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) recommendations for organization and naming conventions.\n- Genomic data, if applicable, will follow established standards such as those provided by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).\n\n## **Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**",
