The latter includes structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features and supporting documentation such as data dictionaries, protocols, and README files. Specifically, the dataset will comprise participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) and multi-modal MRI imaging data. The total volume of the data will depend on the imaging protocols used and the retained derivatives, with the imaging data expected to be the largest component.",
