  "title": "NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan: Social Media Corpus + Instagram RCT Survey + User Analytics Study",
  "funding_agency": "NIH",
  "use_rag": true,
  "inputs": {
    "research_context": "This project analyzes publicly available social media content and evaluates an Instagram-delivered randomized intervention using participant surveys and engagement analytics. Analyses will generate de-identified datasets, derived variables, and documentation to support reproducibility.",
    "data_types": "Data include social media posts/comments (via a third-party vendor), participant survey responses and study arm assignment, program monitoring/engagement analytics, derived coded/cleaned datasets, analysis scripts, and documentation (codebooks, data dictionaries, instruments, README).",
    "data_source": "Social media data will be retrieved through a vendor using documented search parameters. Survey and analytics data will be collected from enrolled adult participants via online tools and linked using study IDs. Processing will include basic quality checks and documented data handling steps.",
    "human_subjects": "Yes. Participant data will be de-identified before sharing. Direct identifiers will not be included in shared datasets. Raw social media content will not be shared when restricted by vendor terms or privacy considerations; derived/coded data will be shared instead.",
    "consent_status": "Participation is voluntary and informed consent will be obtained. Consent will describe data collection, confidentiality protections, monitoring/analytics, and what de-identified data may be shared, including any limits on sharing.",
    "data_volume": "Volume depends on the size of the social media corpus and retained analytics. Public releases will include de-identified survey tables, derived/coded datasets, documentation, and analysis code; restricted raw vendor content will be excluded."
