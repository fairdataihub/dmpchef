  "inputs": {
    "research_context": "Demographic, clinical, and MRI, 1H fMRS and fMRI imaging data will be acquired from 110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls (described in detail in sections C.3 and C.4 of this application). All data will be deidentified prior to receipt by the repository, but the information needed to generate a global unique identifier for the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) will be collected for each subject.",
    "data_types": "Demographic and clinical data (tabular) and MRI-based imaging data including structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS, along with derived imaging measures/features and supporting documentation (data dictionaries, protocols, README).",
    "data_source": "Data will be collected from human research participants (110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls) under an approved study protocol. MRI data will be acquired using standardized scan protocols, and clinical/demographic measures will be collected using study instruments and recorded in study databases.",
    "human_subjects": "Yes",
    "consent_status": "All research participants will be consented for broad data sharing.",
    "data_volume": "The dataset will include participant-level clinical/demographic tables for 220 participants and multi-modal MRI imaging data (structural MRI, fMRI, and 1H fMRS). Total volume will depend on imaging protocols and retained derivatives, with imaging data expected to be the largest component."
